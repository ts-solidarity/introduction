# Introduction
About myself, my goals, my education and stuff.


Now that I will be going to the college to be a computer scientist, I need to improve my abilities.
It is not an easy path at all, it takes courage and determination, which I don't have much. Yet I am here, trying to make progress nonetheless.
I have a few goals in my mind. A new environment means a new myself. I will be changed inevitably by those around me. I just hope it'll be a change in the right direction.
I have interest in C++ and game programming. They will be my upmost priority. Even though they teach Java at college in general, I am striving for knowledge when it comes to such a flexible, fundamental language as C++. I absolutely love it.
Going to gym, improving communication skills, yeah sure. They are on my mind too.

Let's see how it goes, I guess! :)
